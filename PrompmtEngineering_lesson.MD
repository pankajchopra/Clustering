Certainly, I'd be happy to create a step-by-step lesson plan for teaching prompt engineering, focusing on conversational chatbots using a multiagent approach. This plan is designed for beginners who have no prior knowledge of prompt engineering. Let's break it down into manageable steps with examples and code snippets.

Lesson Plan: Prompt Engineering for Conversational Chatbots (Multiagent Approach)

Lesson 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering
2. Explain its importance in conversational AI
3. Introduce the concept of multiagent systems in chatbots

Lesson 2: Sanitizing the Prompt

1. Explain the importance of sanitizing input
2. Demonstrate techniques for cleaning and normalizing text

Example code:

```python
import re

def sanitize_prompt(prompt):
    # Remove special characters and extra whitespace
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', prompt)
    sanitized = ' '.join(sanitized.split())
    return sanitized.lower()

# Usage
user_prompt = "Hello, how are you? I'm feeling great!!!"
clean_prompt = sanitize_prompt(user_prompt)
print(clean_prompt)
# Output: hello how are you im feeling great
```

Lesson 3: Dividing Long Prompts

1. Discuss the benefits of breaking down complex prompts
2. Introduce sentence and topic segmentation techniques

Example code:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

def divide_prompt(prompt):
    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(prompt)
    return sentences

# Usage
long_prompt = "I want to book a flight. It should be for next week. I prefer morning departures."
divided_prompt = divide_prompt(long_prompt)
print(divided_prompt)
# Output: ['I want to book a flight.', 'It should be for next week.', 'I prefer morning departures.']
```

Lesson 4: Extracting Tasks from Prompts

1. Teach how to identify action items or intents in prompts
2. Introduce basic NLP techniques for intent recognition

Example code:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_tasks(prompt):
    doc = nlp(prompt)
    tasks = []
    for token in doc:
        if token.dep_ == "ROOT" and token.pos_ == "VERB":
            tasks.append(token.text)
    return tasks

# Usage
prompt = "Book a flight and reserve a hotel room"
extracted_tasks = extract_tasks(prompt)
print(extracted_tasks)
# Output: ['Book', 'reserve']
```

Lesson 5: Refining Prompts

1. Explain the importance of clarity and specificity in prompts
2. Demonstrate techniques for expanding and clarifying prompts

Example code:

```python
def refine_prompt(task, context):
    refined_prompt = f"Please {task} with the following details: {context}"
    return refined_prompt

# Usage
task = "book a flight"
context = "from New York to London, departing next Tuesday, economy class"
refined = refine_prompt(task, context)
print(refined)
# Output: Please book a flight with the following details: from New York to London, departing next Tuesday, economy class
```

Lesson 6: Structuring LLM Responses

1. Introduce response templates
2. Teach how to guide LLM outputs into specific formats

Example code:

```python
def create_structured_prompt(task, context, response_template):
    prompt = f"""
    Task: {task}
    Context: {context}
    
    Please provide your response in the following format:
    {response_template}
    """
    return prompt

# Usage
task = "Summarize the weather forecast"
context = "Next week in New York City"
template = """
Summary: [Brief summary of the weather]
Temperature Range: [Low] to [High]
Precipitation: [Yes/No]
Recommended Activities: [List of suitable activities]
"""

structured_prompt = create_structured_prompt(task, context, template)
print(structured_prompt)
```

Lesson 7: Implementing a Multiagent System

1. Explain the concept of multiple agents in a conversation
2. Demonstrate how to create and coordinate multiple agents

Example code:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

    def process(self, prompt):
        # Implement agent-specific logic here
        return f"{self.name} ({self.role}): Processed '{prompt}'"

def multiagent_conversation(prompt, agents):
    responses = []
    for agent in agents:
        responses.append(agent.process(prompt))
    return responses

# Usage
agents = [
    Agent("InfoBot", "Information Retrieval"),
    Agent("TaskBot", "Task Execution"),
    Agent("SummaryBot", "Summarization")
]

user_prompt = "Tell me about the weather in New York and suggest activities"
results = multiagent_conversation(user_prompt, agents)
for response in results:
    print(response)
```

Lesson 8: Putting It All Together

1. Review the entire process from prompt input to structured output
2. Guide students through a complete example combining all learned techniques

Final Project:
Have students create a simple conversational chatbot that can handle multi-turn conversations, using the techniques learned in the course. The chatbot should be able to:

1. Sanitize user input
2. Break down complex queries
3. Extract and prioritize tasks
4. Refine prompts for clarity
5. Structure responses using templates
6. Utilize multiple agents for different aspects of the conversation

This lesson plan provides a structured approach to teaching prompt engineering for conversational chatbots using a multiagent system. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques. The code examples give students practical experience in implementing these concepts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this lesson plan or provide more detailed examples for any of the topics covered?
