 This plan is designed for beginners who have no prior knowledge of prompt engineering.
Let's break it down into manageable steps with examples and code snippets.

Lesson Plan: Prompt Engineering for Conversational Chatbots (Multiagent Approach)

Lesson 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering
2. Explain its importance in conversational AI
3. Introduce the concept of multiagent systems in chatbots


1. Define prompt engineering

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing input prompts for language models to generate desired outputs. It involves crafting clear, specific instructions that guide AI models to produce accurate, relevant, and useful responses.

2. Explain its importance in conversational AI

Prompt engineering is crucial in conversational AI for several reasons:

a) Improved accuracy: Well-crafted prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses from the AI.

b) Enhanced user experience: Clear prompts result in more natural and coherent conversations.

c) Task-specific optimization: Prompts can be tailored to specific use cases or domains.

d) Efficiency: Good prompts can reduce the number of interactions needed to achieve the desired outcome.

e) Consistency: Properly engineered prompts help maintain consistent AI behavior across various scenarios.

Exercise: Have students compare responses from an AI model using a vague prompt vs. a well-engineered prompt.

Example:
Vague prompt: "Tell me about cars."
Well-engineered prompt: "Provide a brief overview of the major technological advancements in electric cars over the past decade, focusing on battery technology and driving range improvements."

3. Introduce the concept of multiagent systems in chatbots

Multiagent systems in chatbots involve using multiple specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of a conversation or task.

Key points to cover:
a) Definition of multiagent systems
b) Advantages of using multiple agents:
   - Specialization and expertise in specific areas
   - Improved scalability and modularity
   - Enhanced problem-solving capabilities through collaboration

c) Types of agents in a conversational system:
   - Natural Language Understanding (NLU) agent
   - Dialog Management agent
   - Information Retrieval agent
   - Task Execution agent
   - Natural Language Generation (NLG) agent

d) How agents interact and collaborate

Example: Describe a simple multiagent chatbot for a travel booking system:
- NLU Agent: Interprets user's travel requirements
- Information Retrieval Agent: Searches for available flights and hotels
- Dialog Management Agent: Manages the conversation flow and decides when to ask for more information
- Task Execution Agent: Books the selected options
- NLG Agent: Generates natural language responses to the user

Hands-on Activity:
TODO: Create a  multi-agent Conversational Chatbot.

Discussion Questions:
1. How does prompt engineering differ from traditional programming?
2. What are some potential challenges in designing effective prompts for conversational AI?
3. The use of multiple agents improve the performance of a chatbot compared to a single-agent system?



Lesson 2: Sanitizing the Prompt

1. Explain the importance of sanitizing input
2. Demonstrate techniques for cleaning and normalizing text

Sanitizing the prompt is a crucial step in prompt engineering for several important reasons:

Security:
Prevents injection attacks: Malicious users might try to insert code or commands into prompts that could compromise the system.
Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive information: Unsanitized prompts might contain personal or confidential data.

Consistency:
Ensures uniform input format: By removing or standardizing special characters, punctuation, and formatting, you create a consistent base for processing.
Improves model performance: Many language models perform better with standardized input.

Noise reduction:
Removes irrelevant information: Extraneous characters or any formatting in the prompt can be seen as noise by the model, and potentially it can affect the output.
Focuses on essential content: Sanitization helps isolate the core message or intent of the prompt.

Error prevention:
Avoids processing errors: Some special characters or formatting might cause errors in downstream processing steps.
Reduces the chances of unexpected behavior in the AI model.

Normalization:
Standardizes text case: Converting all text to lowercase (or uppercase) can help with consistency.
Handles common variations: For example, converting various Unicode representations of quotation marks to a standard format.

Compliance:
Helps meet data protection regulations: Sanitization can be part of ensuring that no prohibited or sensitive data is processed.
Supports audit trails: Clean, standardized inputs are easier to log and review.

Improved analysis:
Facilitates better text analysis: Clean data is essential for accurate natural language processing tasks.
Enhances pattern recognition: Standardized text makes it easier to identify common patterns or intents.

Resource efficiency:
Reduces unnecessary processing: By removing irrelevant data early, you can save computational resources in later stages.


Cross-platform compatibility:
Ensures prompts work across different systems: Sanitized text is less likely to contain characters or formats that might be incompatible with certain platforms or databases.

Example code:

```python
import re

def sanitize_prompt(prompt):
    # Remove special characters and extra whitespace
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', prompt)
    sanitized = ' '.join(sanitized.split())
    return sanitized.lower()

# Usage
user_prompt = "Hello, how are you? I'm feeling great!!!"
clean_prompt = sanitize_prompt(user_prompt)
print(clean_prompt)
# Output: hello how are you im feeling great
```

Lesson 3: Dividing Long Prompts

1. Discuss the benefits of breaking down complex prompts
2. Introduce sentence and topic segmentation techniques

Example code:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')

def divide_prompt(prompt):
    sentences = nltk.sent_tokenize(prompt)
    return sentences

# Usage
long_prompt = "I want to book a flight. It should be for next week. I prefer morning departures."
divided_prompt = divide_prompt(long_prompt)
print(divided_prompt)
# Output: ['I want to book a flight.', 'It should be for next week.', 'I prefer morning departures.']
```

Lesson 4: Extracting Tasks from Prompts

1. Teach how to identify action items or intents in prompts
2. Introduce basic NLP techniques for intent recognition

Example code:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_tasks(prompt):
    doc = nlp(prompt)
    tasks = []
    for token in doc:
        if token.dep_ == "ROOT" and token.pos_ == "VERB":
            tasks.append(token.text)
    return tasks

# Usage
prompt = "Book a flight and reserve a hotel room"
extracted_tasks = extract_tasks(prompt)
print(extracted_tasks)
# Output: ['Book', 'reserve']
```

Lesson 5: Refining Prompts

1. Explain the importance of clarity and specificity in prompts
2. Demonstrate techniques for expanding and clarifying prompts

Example code:

```python
def refine_prompt(task, context):
    refined_prompt = f"Please {task} with the following details: {context}"
    return refined_prompt

# Usage
task = "book a flight"
context = "from New York to London, departing next Tuesday, economy class"
refined = refine_prompt(task, context)
print(refined)
# Output: Please book a flight with the following details: from New York to London, departing next Tuesday, economy class
```

Lesson 6: Structuring LLM Responses

1. Introduce response templates
2. Teach how to guide LLM outputs into specific formats

Example code:

```python
def create_structured_prompt(task, context, response_template):
    prompt = f"""
    Task: {task}
    Context: {context}
    
    Please provide your response in the following format:
    {response_template}
    """
    return prompt

# Usage
task = "Summarize the weather forecast"
context = "Next week in New York City"
template = """
Summary: [Brief summary of the weather]
Temperature Range: [Low] to [High]
Precipitation: [Yes/No]
Recommended Activities: [List of suitable activities]
"""

structured_prompt = create_structured_prompt(task, context, template)
print(structured_prompt)
```

Lesson 7: Implementing a Multiagent System

1. Explain the concept of multiple agents in a conversation
2. Demonstrate how to create and coordinate multiple agents

Example code:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role

    def process(self, prompt):
        # Implement agent-specific logic here
        return f"{self.name} ({self.role}): Processed '{prompt}'"

def multiagent_conversation(prompt, agents):
    responses = []
    for agent in agents:
        responses.append(agent.process(prompt))
    return responses

# Usage
agents = [
    Agent("InfoBot", "Information Retrieval"),
    Agent("TaskBot", "Task Execution"),
    Agent("SummaryBot", "Summarization")
]

user_prompt = "Tell me about the weather in New York and suggest activities"
results = multiagent_conversation(user_prompt, agents)
for response in results:
    print(response)
```

Lesson 8: Putting It All Together

1. Review the entire process from prompt input to structured output
2. Guide students through a complete example combining all learned techniques

Final Project:
Have students create a simple conversational chatbot that can handle multi-turn conversations, using the techniques learned in the course. The chatbot should be able to:

1. Sanitize user input
2. Break down complex queries
3. Extract and prioritize tasks
4. Refine prompts for clarity
5. Structure responses using templates
6. Utilize multiple agents for different aspects of the conversation

This lesson plan provides a structured approach to teaching prompt engineering for conversational chatbots using a multiagent system. Each lesson builds upon the previous one, gradually introducing more complex concepts and techniques. The code examples give students practical experience in implementing these concepts.
